# Magnetic_Rotating_Setup
This repository documents a rotating magnet setup that uses a stepper motor to precisely control two parallel rotating magnets. The system is designed for applications requiring controlled magnetic torque while minimizing unwanted field gradients.

**Repository Structure**  
The project is divided into three main chapters:

**1. Setup Base** – Component list, assembly file, and part files.  
**2. Electronics** – Component list, wiring diagram, Arduino code, Nextion communication protocol, Nextion code, and assembly and part files.  
**3. Magnets** – Component list, field shaping algorithm, and assembly and part files.

This repository provides CAD files, schematics, and code for replicating and customizing the setup.
